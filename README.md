RICO is a dedicated set of [tools developed by VESNX](https://vesnx.com) to record and report suspicious activities that could indicate cyber abuse or compromise. Our goal is to aid victims of cybercrime by alerting them to potential threats and providing useful recommendations on how to minimize the potential impact.

## What We Do

RICO records a wide array of suspicious activities, including:

- Abusive web forms submissions
- Suspected credential theft incidents
- Suspicious login attempts
- Potential credit card fraud
- Identity theft indications

By alerting victims to these potential threats, we hope to empower them to take necessary actions to secure their data and protect themselves.

## Why We Do It

Our goal is to create a safer internet that empowers and informs users. With RICO, users with varying levels of IT knowledge can obtain transparent and direct security measurements to strengthen their in-house resilience againstÂ cybercrime.

## We Value Feedback and Contributions

We warmly welcome feedback and contributions from the community. We are committed to improving RICO continually and appreciate any insights, suggestions, or potential collaborations.

## RICO & Project CARE

RICO is proud to work in tandem with [Project CARE](https://github.com/vesnx/VESNX-Cybercrime-Assistance) (Cybercrime Assistance and Legal Representation). Once RICO records an incident, the information feeds into Project CARE. The legal community under Project CARE is ready to assist, providing legal representation and guidance for victims of cybercrimes.

Together, RICO and Project CARE are committed to combating cybercrimes, empowering victims, and fostering a safer digital environment.
